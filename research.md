## Building A Web Code Editor Using Typescript


### Introduction
Whether you're creating a small script, experimenting with new ideas, or tackling complex projects, a code editor becomes your trusted companion when coding.

This is an interesting project to work on because having the knowledge of how to build a code editor will give you ideas on how to approach other projects that require you to integrate a code editor to show some functionality.

>The target of our project would be to build the code editor using typescript and add the 'splashkit' library to it.

TypeScript is a strong, open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is built on top of JavaScript, offering additional features and static typing.

Adding custom libraries to your own code editor is typically not specific to TypeScript but rather involves configuring your editor to recognize and provide code assistance for those libraries while you write code.

We will divide our project into three phases:
- Plan
- Design
- Launch

### Plan
To create a web application that has a code editor we'll look at some examples:

- [Code mirror](https://codemirror.net/) is an open-source code editor library and a good choice as it has open-source support and reputable support community.

### Design
